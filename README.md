# Leela

Leela is a simulation that shows the simplified geometry of orbital mechanics of the Earth, Moon and Sun, among a few other things.  It is intended as a teaching aid for anyone who is curious to understand various phenomena such as:

* occurrence of days and nights on earth
* phases of the moon
* Solar eclipses: partial, total, annular and hybrid
* Lunar eclipses: partial, total and penumbral
* six-month-long day and night at the north and south pole
* tilted orbital planes of earth and moon
* precession motion of earth
* Moon's nodal precession
* Apparent Retrograde motion of planets, e.g. Mars* 
* Mercury and Venus transit

Object sizes and distances are **not** shown to scale.  By doing so, it makes it easy to understand the concepts.

The program makes heavy use of keyboard shortcuts. Consequently, there is a learning curve before you can efficiently operate the program.  Mouse and Keyboard navigation documentaion can be accessed from the Help menu.
