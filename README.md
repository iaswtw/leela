This simulation of the sun, moon and earth system is intended to be a teaching aid for anyone who is curious to understand the orbital mechanics of these three celestial bodies.

Objects are not shown to the scale.  By doing so, it makes it easy to understand the concepts such as:
* the occurrance of days and nights on earth
* phases of the moon
* Solar eclipses: partial, total, annular and hybrid
* Lunar eclipses: partial, total and penumbral
* six month long day and six month long night on north and south pole
* tilted orbital planes of earth and moon
* precession motion of earth
* rotation of moons orbit
